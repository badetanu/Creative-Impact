As outdoor enthusiasts continue to diversify their interests, there is an increasing demand for products that can adapt to a variety of settings and requirements, further fueling growth in this segment of the market.</p><p>As camping and outdoor exploration grow in popularity, this "Others" category is expected to expand, driven by innovations in outdoor equipment that cater to niche needs. For instance, specialized camping gadgets designed for extreme weather conditions, survival scenarios, or comfort-centric options for glamping are becoming more accessible. The demand for cross-functional tools, such as multi-purpose camp axes, portable water filtration systems, and advanced navigation tools, is expected to drive growth in this segment.
